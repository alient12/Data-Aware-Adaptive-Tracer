# ðŸ“ˆ BPFNexus  
**Adaptive, Data-Aware Tracing for BPF**

---

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**BPFNexus** is an adaptive tracing engine built on top of **BPFtrace**. It connects multiple tracing strategiesâ€”**manual triggers**, **algorithm-driven auto triggers**, and **system health monitoring**â€”into one cohesive system.  

Users provide a **YAML configuration file** that defines:
- The **target command** to run under tracing.
- **Tracing logic**â€”manual triggers, adaptive auto triggers (like rare value detection), and system health monitors (e.g., CPU, disk).
- Output locations and BPFtrace script paths.

BPFNexus **automatically converts this configuration into a valid BPFtrace script**, runs it, and dynamically updates the tracing logic during execution based on the data observed.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… **Flexible Trigger Logic**: Combine manual and adaptive triggers.  
âœ… **Command-Centric Tracing**: Run any binary (e.g., `python3`, `myapp`) under tracing with a simple config.  
âœ… **Real-Time Adaptation**: Automatically updates BPFtrace scripts based on evolving conditions (e.g., rare argument detection, future algorithms).  
âœ… **Logging and Script Paths**
